- Mason's Tools
- Carpenter's Tools
- Smith's Tools
- Seige Weaponry
- Vehicles

## Materials
Usually use materials in Bulk for lasting creations, but for makeshift solutions, generally uses whatever is available.

## Synergies
Engineers are not unlike [[Tinkerer]]s as a form of generalist revolving around solving problems. When these two work together, the most intricate of creations are created.

[[Textile Worker]]s often help Engineers with any flexible parts.

## Areas of Work
On long-term projects, Engineers are typically architects and site managers, rather than laborers. But they are knowledgable enough about the work that goes into their creations to be dangerous on their own.

### Fortification
Walls, Ditches, Moats are all things Engineers know how to plan to be maximally efficient.

### Transportation
Be it a vehicle, road, or bridge, Engineers know how to make something that allows for people and goods to move from point A to point B.

### Destruction
What's more fun than building something designed to withstand attack? Tearing something like that down!
Since they know how to build it, they also know how to tear it down.
