# Crafting
###### tags: #player-info #homebrew #crafting 

Anything your characters use was crafted by someone. As salvagers, you're probably used to creating specialized tools for your work. I would encourage you to work with me if you come up with an item idea (magical or mundane) that would be cool for your character or the party.

The crafting system we're using is based on Kibblestasty's Crafting system. It's quite extensible but relatively simple at its core.

## Specialties
As adventurers focused on recovering things of value from the Mournland, you typically have at least one specialty you're good at when it comes to crafting. These "Disciplines" are each generalists in their own area of study, fitting with the theme of your ability to put together solutions to problems which work "good enough for now."

Consider a Specialist as having proficiency in the tools often used by their specialty when making an ability check related to it.

When a Background or Class feature would grant a Tool Proficiency, replace it instead with a Specialty below.

## Recipes
With the proper tools a charcter can begin crafting any item. Every Item has a Recipe composed of two parts: Materials and Time required. Occassionaly there is a third part in the form of a Magical Formula required for particularly magical items.

### Materials
Different crafing specialties have different materials they primarily deal with.

Almost all materials can be bought from merchants, particularly if your reputation is good with [[House Cannith]]. But most can be gathered/harvested in the wild, salvaged from other items, or crafted out of other more basic materials.

Materials have rarities, and many have subtypes.

- Arcane Essence
	- Divine
	- Arcane
	- Primal
- Reagents
	- Curative
	- Reactive
	- Poisonous
- Metal (Ingots)
	- Many Types of special metals
- Magical Inks
- Parts
	- Fancy Parts
- Ingredients
	- Freshly Harvested Ingredients
	- Supplies
- Wood (Branches)


### Time
Time is represented by "Crafting Checks" which occur in 2 hour incremenets.

Each time you have 2 hours to spare (most commonly while [[Making Camp]] for a long rest and during travel or downtime), you can make a crafting check to make progress on an item you're working on.

On a success, 2 hours of progress is added, on a failure, that time was spent figuring out how _not_ to make the thing.

Instead of rolling, you can spend twice as much time (4 hours for one check) and treat this as rolling a 10 on the d20.

It is not possible to work on a project for more than 8 hours in a single day.


### Magical Formula
Spell Scrolls and Lesser Wands require the crafter to know the Magical Formula of the spell being encapsulated within the item. There are several ways to learn a spell's formula:
- Be able to cast the spell yourself
- Have it in your spellbook or book of rituals if applicable
- Have another Spell Scroll of the spell (though this makes crafting more difficult)
- Study the formula and record it from someone else. [[House Sivis]] is known to catalog such formulae, if your reputation with them is good enough they are willing to sell this knowledge.
