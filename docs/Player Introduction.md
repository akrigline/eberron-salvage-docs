## Setting the Stage

Eberron. A war-torn continent littered with ruins ancient and recent. Magic is very real in this land, and the various societies on the continent have increasingly studyied, tinkered with, and harnessed its practical powers. "Artificery" is a relatively newly popular application of magic in real-world scenarios.

> #### Character Backstory Prompt:
> Are you trusting or untrusting of "these newfangled artificers"? Is there a particular form or school of magic you're distrusting of?
> Example Forms of Magic: "Divine," "Primal," and "Occult"
> Schools of Magic: Conjuration. Necromancy. Evocation. Abjuration. Transmutation. Divination. Enchantment. Illusion.
> Depending on your age (>150 years to be safe), you might remember a time before many newer magical amenities existed.

The Nations of Eberron engaged in a hundred years long war known as "The Last War" that tore apart a once united Kingdom of Galifar. During this time, the Great Dragonmarked Houses rose to power as neutral parties selling their services to all. Why the war started is a matter for scholars to debate, but everyone knows why it ended: Day of Mourning.

The once proud nation of Cyre was destroyed on that day by a magical cataclysm that no one knows the cause of. Cyre's borders are now a roiling wall of dead grey mist. The land within the walls of fog are twisted by strange magics now called "The Mournland".

In the years since the Day of Mourning, a tenuous peace has settled on the nations of Eberron.

> #### Character Backstory Prompt:
> The Day of Mourning is talked about similarly to how we talk about 9/11.
> What was your character doing on the Day of Mourning?
> If you were from Cyre, how did you survive, or did something happen to you that day?

Our story will focus on a particularly enterprising group that has sprung up on the edge of the Mournland. The great houses have turned their attentions towards recovering things of value from the Mournland, and that has created opportunity for people drawn to such dangerous work.

> #### Character Backstory Prompt:
> What draws your character to work with other salvagers and foray into the Mournland?
> 
> Do you hope to curry favor with a particular Guild?
> Perhaps you seek something in particular of your own in the Mournland, but lack the experience to find it yet.
> Or perhaps you're simply drawn to dangerous work that pays well.


## Salvation's Salvagers

The town of Salvation lies less than a mile from the border of the Mournland. It is a hub of guild activity focused on scouting, exploring, and recovering valuables from the lands within the Mournland.

This is "home base" for our rag-tag team of salvagers and will be returned to frequently. Most of the notable houses have set up bases here and happily provide services in exchange for coin. These same houses frequently have work for salvagers and post public contracts to the town Job Board managed by House Sivis.

## Other World Details

### Dragonmarked Houses

There are 12 dragonmarks, distinctive magical enhancements which are passed down genetically. These dragonmarks allow the bearer to control certain aspects of magic more easily than one without such a mark. As a result, the mark-bearers formed powerful Guilds to offer their services independantly of national boundaries or alliance.

|  Dragonmark |       House       |       Race      |                   Guild Specialties                   |

|   Finding   |      Tharashk     | Human, half-orc |       Bounty hunting, investigation, prospecting      |

|   Scribing  |       Sivis       |      Gnome      |        Communication, translation, verification       |
|   Sentinel  |      Deneith      |      Human      |                Bodyguards, mercenaries                |
|    Shadow   | Phiarlan/Thuranni |       Elf       | Entertainment, espionage / Entertainment, assassination |
|    Storm    |      Lyrandar     |     Half-elf    |               Air and sea transportation              |
|   Warding   |      Kundarak     |      Dwarf      |               Banking, storage, prisons               |

These guilds have immense political power and currying favor with a particular guild is likely to get one more political clout than doing the same with a nation.


### Notable (Nearby) Nations

The largest central nations of Eberron are referred to as "The Five Nations"

- Aundair - Known for its education system and academic study
- Breland - Known for its industry and resources
- Karrnath - Known for its military tradition and the use of undead during the war
- Thrane - Known for the Church of the Silver Flame's devotion to rooting out evil
- Cyre - Known for being destroyed at the end of the last war

There are other lesser nations as well that arose independant during the Last War, but which didn't participate much otherwise.

- Talenta Plains - A vast grassland of nomadic halflings and dinosaurs
- Valenar - A new elven nation founded by mercenaries of the last war
- Eldeen Reaches - A fertile farmland nation with close ties to Orcish Druids
- Darguun - A young, volatile goblinoid nation.
- Zilargo - A gnomish nation of uncannily pleasant people steeped in intruige.
- Q'barra - A jungle nation populated by lizardfolk and dragonborn.


### Magic is Science

Magic is treated as a science to be studied and taught in Eberron. Magic of approximately 3rd (Spell) Level and lower is commonplace in the world.

However, powerful magic users capable of casting 4th spell level and up spells are rare. These people have great influence on the world around them and generally find themselves mixed up with powerful political problems if they're not careful.

### Spritual Beliefs

Divine magic is undeniably real. Clerics Heal, Ghosts posses, and Undead Soldiers crumble quickly when radiant damage hits them. But it is unclear where this divine magic comes from in Eberron.

Most people acknowledge the pantheon of the loosely aligned Sovereign Host and its malign shadow, the Dark Six.

The Sovereign Host is less of an organized religion and more of an expression of the spiritual intuitions of all things "good" in the world. On the flip side, the Dark Six are expressions of all things corrupt, evil, and fearful.

This was the dominant faith of the Kingdom of Galifar and holds sway over most of Eberronâ€”except for Thrane, which favors a more organized Church of the Silver Flame dedicated to rooting out evil directly.
