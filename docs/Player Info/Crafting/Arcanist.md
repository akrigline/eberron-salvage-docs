Arcanists bind Magical energies in otherwise ordinary objects to exhibit extraordinary powers. This binding is a difficult and expensive process, but the outcome is often wondrous.

Often uses:

- Calligrapher's Supplies
- Jeweler's Tools

## Materials
Magical Essences: Arcane, Primal, Divine
Dragonshards in particular are often sought after to create Enchanted items.

## Synergies
Arcanists usually enhance an existing item, giving it new powers and abilities. As a result, they work well with most other crafting disciplines that aim to create permanent items.
- [[Blacksmith]], [[Woodworker]], [[Textile Worker]], and [[Tinkerer]] create items that can be enchanted
- Enchanting often requires detailed [[Calligrapher]] work to help bind the magic more efficiently.

## Areas of Work

### Enchanting
Not to be confused with the school of magic, Enchanting is classic magic item creation which takes a mundane item and adds effects to it.

Any Wondrous magic item was created as a result of some enchanting work, and thus Arcanists can theoretically create any magic item they desire. Doing so is an expensive and difficult process, which only gets harder the more wondrous the item being created is.
