Blacksmiths shape metal to their whimsy in order to create protective armor, biting weapons, and other miscellaneous but useful things.

Often uses:
- Smith's Tools

## Materials
Metal Ingots and scraps of all different types are what a Blacksmith requires to work. Many metals recovered from the Mournland have inherent magical properties which can be enhanced when re-forged correctly.

## Synergies
Blacksmiths typically work well with most other crafting disciplines that aim to create permanent items, metal is ubiquitous in its ability to strengthen most any other work. These in particular often help a blacksmith create things:
- [[Textile Worker]] helps make Armors
- [[Woodworker]] helps make Weapons
- [[Arcanist]] can enchant works with magical powers

## Areas of Work

### General
Any common adventuring gear which is mostly metal can be crafted by a blacksmith:
- Ball Bearings
- Pitons
- Chains
- Bells
- Manacles

### Armorsmithing
Most Medium and Heavy armors require a blacksmith's touch to create. As do shields.

### Weaponsmithing
Most simple and all Martial weapons require a blacksmith to forge.

Blacksmiths also know how to design and enhance custom weaponry to better suit the fighting styles of adventurers.
