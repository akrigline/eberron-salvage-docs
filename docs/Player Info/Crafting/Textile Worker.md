Textile workers often deal with more flexible materials than other disciplines care to deal with.

Often uses:

- Cobbler's Tools
- Leatherworker's Tools
- Weaver's Tools
- Disguise Kit
- Rope


## Materials
Scraps and Bolts of Cloth, Hides and Leathers 

## Synergies
Often helps [[Blacksmith]] in armor creation.
Frequently enjoys working with a [[Calligrapher]] to spice up the design of some apparel.

## Areas of Work

### Leatherwork
Light and some Medium armors require Textile work more than Blacksmith work.

Many of the Mournland's monsters have magic-imbued hides which can be enhanced with the right processes.

### Knot-tying
Adventurers without rope might as well sign their own death certificate. Being able to tie expert knots in said rope is an invaluable asset.

### Clothing and Apparel
Being dressed appropriately goes a long way in high society. The wilderness often places uncharitable weather in the path of the ill-prepared.

### Disguise
When attempting to blend in with a particular group of people, apparel is often the first step.
