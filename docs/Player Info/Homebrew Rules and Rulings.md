# Homebrew Rules and Rulings
###### tags: #player-info

Some changes and rulings for this game taking place in Eberron.

## Character Creation

### Race/Origin/Lineage
All races are available except Variant Human, use Custom Lineage from Tasha's instead. Highly recommend using the rules from Tasha's for origin ability score customization.

If you're playing something from a book that isn't the PHB, Volo's or Eberron, reach out to me to make sure the backstory fits.

Some Eberron Races in particular might have in-story baggage that you should be aware of:
- Warforged are struggling to find their place in the post-war world, and there are plenty of opinions from plenty of people about what that place is. These attitudes are fair game for me to play with.
- Dragonmarked variants of races typically have at least some ties to the Guild of that Mark, even if they have left the guild service formally, they at least know people there. Those strings are fair game for me to pull.
- Some races are from nations which might have or recently have had conflicts with other nations, and those bonds are fair game for me to tug on.

### Motivations
Your character will be the most motivated to play through this campaign's story if they are motivated by either:
- Favor with a particular Guild or Faction (will have a list)
- Cold hard Cash
- General exploration and discovery of the unknowns

## Magic Items

There are no +1/2/3 weapons or armor or spellcasting foci in this setting. Instead, magical items do magical things.

## Class Changes

### All Classes

Any class with Optional Features from Tasha's Cauldron of Everything should have those features turned on. For features which replace other features, you may decide to not use those.

#### Spellcasting

All spellcasting classes may be treated as Prepared Spellcasting Classes.

### Artificer

#### Infusions

The "Enhanced ____" Infusions and all effects that add a "+X" to an item are removed. These infusions replace them:

> More Details about [[Artificer Infusions]]

#### Feature Additions

##### Project
Artificers are always working on _something_. Using the [[Crafting Overview]] rules, pick an item that your character is working on crafting. As part of any long rest, you may make progress towards that item's completion, without affecting your ability to keep watch or interfere with your ability to take a long rest.

If this item is magical in nature, it must be one of the items you are able to make with an infusion you know.

##### Ready for Anything
A number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, you may undergo a ritual lasting one minute which swaps out an Artificer spell you have prepared for another one of that same spell level. This does not apply to cantrips.

> Rules Note
> Rituals require concentration to execute, so any spell being concentrated on at the start of that minute will fade.


### Fighter

#### Maneuvers
Any maneuver learned may be treated as a "prepared" maneuver, meaning that as part of a long rest, you may switch that maneuver for another which is available to you.


### Ranger

#### Feature Replacements
Replace Natural Explorer with Deft Explorer.
Replace Favored Enemy with Favored Foe.

For Beast Master rangers, replace Ranger’s Companion with Primal Companion.

### Rogue

All Theif subclass features become part of the base class.


### Sorcerer

All sorcerer subclasses have a list of subclass spells which are innately learned and do not count against the number of spells known.

#### Font of Magic
The number of Sorcery Points you have available to you increases to be equal to "Sorcerer Level + Charisma Modifier" (minimum 2).

#### Metamagic
Metamagic options are Prepared (you may switch them out at the end of a long rest). You can prepare a number of metamagic options equal to your proficiency bonus.


### Paladin

#### Alternate Smite Effects
Instead of the standard smite damage, you may cause the effects of any Smite Spell you have prepared. This does not count as casting a spell. If a smite has an ongoing effect and requires concentration, that is still the case.


### Warlock

Warlocks may be Int based instead of Cha based if desired.

#### Invocation Spells
All Invocations spells may be cast without spending a Warlock spell slot, if they currently require such. All other limitations still apply.


### Wizard

TBD - Something changes to counter the prepared-ness of other spellcasters

Possibly the "Ready for Anything" from artificer modifications above. If you wanna play a wizard, reach out and lets talk.

## Contraditions to RAW

### Potions

Pulling out a potion and drinking it yourself is a bonus action.

Tossing a potion from player to player is a 'free' object interaction and is fine as long as it's one of the two players' turns, or there aren't extenuating circumstances.

Force-feeding a potion is an action.

Force-feeding a potion on an unwilling target is a contested check similar to a grapple.

### Spell Scrolls

If you have an Arcana Proficiency you may attempt to cast a spell from a spell scroll by making an Arcana Check (DC equals 10 + the spell’s level). Spell Scrolls of spells not on your spellcasting modifier or Intelligence

### Short Rests

Short Rests take 10 minutes. Casting a ritual spell cannot count as a short rest.

### Fitful Rests

Away from society's safety and security, long rests are only partially effective. Instead of restoring full resources and spell slots, only half of max are recovered from a fitful long rest.

The rule of thumb is "do you feel like you should be keeping watch?" If so, you're getting in a fitful rest.

### Unseen Attackers

A small tweak to how being unseen affects advantage and disadvantage.

> When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it **if you can see it**.

### Heavily Obscured Areas

Heavily Obscured Areas (e.g. Fog Clouds, Not including full darkness) allow creatures to see well enough within 5ft around them for attacks made against unhidden creatures within that range to not fall under the "unseen attackers" rules.

## Augmentations to RAW

### True Ritual Casting

Any spell that can be Ritual Cast that also has a material component with a gold cost can be done so without the spell prepared provided the caster can Ritual Cast spells and has access to that spell.

### Unexpected Stops

If an object or creature is subjected to an effect that would apply forced movement for some number of feet but they are stopped by a solid surface before that many feet can be moved, both things take 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10ft the moving thing wasn't able to move.

If the moving object or creature is going to collide with another creature of the same size or smaller, that creature must make a DEX Save (DC 10) or both creatures will be prone. On a success the moving thing does not get stopped (the creature dodged out of the way).

### Exhaustion

RAW doesn't use exhaustion very much but it's a good idea that allows us to tinker with the concept of "over extending."

#### Going without sleep

We'll be using a more forgiving tweak of the Optional Rules from Xanathar's Guide to Everything:

> Whenever you end a 48-hour period without finishing a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion.
>
> It becomes harder to fight off exhaustion if you stay awake for multiple days. After the first 48 hours, the DC increases by 5 for each consecutive 24-hour period without a long rest. The DC resets to 10 when you finish a long rest.

#### Exhaustive Magic

In dire circumstances, the time may come when you want to make magic flow more freely from your body. For each "magical resource" (class feature or spellcasting, ask if you're not sure) you spend where you would normally not be allowed to, make a constitution save against your spellcasting DC. If you succeed, the spell is cast. If you fail, the spell is not cast and the slot is lost. Either way, the caster gains one level of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion).

Explanation: Some magical class features with resources attached (Arcane Shot) specify that they are only allowed to be used once per turn. Spellcasting falls into this bucket as well. This ruling allows multiple leveled spells to be attempted on one turn in dire straits.

> ##### Example
>
> Vista is close to death and within range of Cheya's [Healing Word (Lv1)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/healing-word) spell. She also wants to cast [Entangle (Lv1)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/entangle) on this turn. RAW the [rules about casting times](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting#BonusAction) state that she can not cast both of these spells on the same turn.
>
> With Exhaustive Magic, Cheya can choose which spell to cast first for a garunteed cast, then attempt to extert herself to cast the second spell, gaining a point of exhaustion.
>
> 1. Cheya casts Healing Word, she doesn't want Vista to die.
> 2. Cheya tries to cast Entangle, make CON Save against her own Spell Save DC.
>     1. Save is successful, Cheya casts entangle and gains a level of exhaustion.
>     2. Save fails, Cheya burns a Level 1 spell slot and gains a level of exhaustion.
