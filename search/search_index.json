A war-torn continent littered with ruins ancient and recent.

Depending on your age (>150 years to be safe), you might remember a time before many newer magical amenities existed. The Nations of Eberron engaged in a hundred years long war known as \"The Last War\" that tore apart a once united Kingdom of Galifar. During this time, the Great Dragonmarked Houses rose to power as neutral parties selling their services to all. Why the war started is a matter for scholars to debate, but everyone knows why it ended: Day of Mourning. The once proud nation of Cyre was destroyed on that day by a magical cataclysm that no one knows the cause of. Cyre's borders are now a roiling wall of dead grey mist. The land within the walls of fog are twisted by strange magics now called \"The Mournland\". In the years since the Day of Mourning, a tenuous peace has settled on the nations of Eberron. Character Backstory Prompt: \u00b6 The Day of Mourning is talked about similarly to how we talk about 9/11. What was your character doing on the Day of Mourning? If you were from Cyre, how did you survive, or did something happen to you that day? Our story will focus on a particularly enterprising group that has sprung up on the edge of the Mournland. The great houses have turned their attentions towards recovering things of value from the Mournland, and that has created opportunity for people drawn to such dangerous work. Character Backstory Prompt: \u00b6 What draws your character to work with other salvagers and foray into the Mournland? Do you hope to curry favor with a particular Guild? Perhaps you seek something in particular of your own in the Mournland, but lack the experience to find it yet. Or perhaps you're simply drawn to dangerous work that pays well. Salvation's Salvagers \u00b6 The town of Salvation lies less than a mile from the border of the Mournland. It is a hub of guild activity focused on scouting, exploring, and recovering valuables from the lands within the Mournland. This is \"home base\" for our rag-tag team of salvagers and will be returned to frequently. Most of the notable houses have set up bases here and happily provide services in exchange for coin. These same houses frequently have work for salvagers and post public contracts to the town Job Board managed by House Sivis.

These dragonmarks allow the bearer to control certain aspects of magic more easily than one without such a mark. As a result, the mark-bearers formed powerful Guilds to offer their services independantly of national boundaries or alliance.

Notable (Nearby) Nations \u00b6 The largest central nations of Eberron are referred to as \"The Five Nations\" Aundair - Known for its education system and academic study Breland - Known for its industry and resources Karrnath - Known for its military tradition and the use of undead during the war Thrane - Known for the Church of the Silver Flame's devotion to rooting out evil Cyre - Known for being destroyed at the end of the last war There are other lesser nations as well that arose independant during the Last War, but which didn't participate much otherwise. Talenta Plains - A vast grassland of nomadic halflings and dinosaurs Valenar - A new elven nation founded by mercenaries of the last war Eldeen Reaches - A fertile farmland nation with close ties to Orcish Druids Darguun - A young, volatile goblinoid nation. Zilargo - A gnomish nation of uncannily pleasant people steeped in intruige. Q'barra - A jungle nation populated by lizardfolk and dragonborn. Magic is Science \u00b6 Magic is treated as a science to be studied and taught in Eberron. Magic of approximately 3rd (Spell) Level and lower is commonplace in the world. However, powerful magic users capable of casting 4th spell level and up spells are rare. These people have great influence on the world around them and generally find themselves mixed up with powerful political problems if they're not careful. Spritual Beliefs \u00b6 Divine magic is undeniably real. Clerics Heal, Ghosts posses, and Undead Soldiers crumble quickly when radiant damage hits them. But it is unclear where this divine magic comes from in Eberron. Most people acknowledge the pantheon of the loosely aligned Sovereign Host and its malign shadow, the Dark Six. The Sovereign Host is less of an organized religion and more of an expression of the spiritual intuitions of all things \"good\" in the world. On the flip side, the Dark Six are expressions of all things corrupt, evil, and fearful. This was the dominant faith of the Kingdom of Galifar and holds sway over most of Eberron\u2014except for Thrane, which favors a more organized Church of the Silver Flame dedicated to rooting out evil directly.","title":"Player Introduction"},{"location":"Player%20Introduction/#player-introduction","text":"","title":"Player Introduction"},{"location":"Player%20Introduction/#tags-player-info","text":"","title":"tags: #player-info"},{"location":"Player%20Introduction/#setting-the-stage","text":"Eberron.

Reaction is now usable before the attack hits. Rationale This weapon already has a cool ability attached, a minor tweak to make it possible to blind a creature before they hit you, possibly making it miss, is enough to compensate for the missing +1. Repeating Shot \u00b6 No longer grants a +1 to attack and damage rolls. On rolling a 20 on the damage die, this weapon immediately fires a second shot (this second shot cannot proc a third shot). Rationale Having a crossbow you can use without the crossbow master feat is a small perk, but having that crossbow accidentally fire two bolts sometimes is a great perk. Lovingly inspired by Critical Role S2 Repulsion Shield \u00b6 No longer grants a +1 to AC. After being knocked back, if the creature is Large or smaller, they are also knocked prone. Rationale Pushing a creature back only to have them immediately stand up and walk back to you, or even worse flee is decidedly worse than most alternative actions. Knocking the creature prone as well gives this a decent chance of making it so that the creature can't get back at you or your friends on this turn. Returning Weapon \u00b6 No longer grants a +1 to attack and damage rolls. Applicable to any one-handed weapon without the \"Versatile\" property. Grants the weapon the \"Thrown\" property with a range of 20/60, if it did not already have the thrown property. Rationale The most abuse this can suffer is a Throw-able 1d8 damage weapon, which is the same as a Light Crossbow, with dramatically decreased range. Without this infusion, the maximum damage die for a throw-able weapon is 1d6 (Spear/Javelin/Trident). This comes out to an average of +1 damage on such a weapon without the bonus to attacks, which is about the bonus before anyways. Added \u00b6 Smoke Bomb \u00b6 As an action, you can use a smoke bomb to cast the fog cloud spell centered on yourself, without expending a spell slot and requiring no components. The spell lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier and doesn\u2019t require your concentration. When you cast fog cloud in this way, you can choose for it to have a radius of 5, 10, 15, or 20 feet. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short rest. Shocking Weapon \u00b6 When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target must succeed a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or become stunned until the start of your next turn. Grappling Hook \u00b6 You can forgo any attack you make as part of the Attack action to throw your grappling hook at a target within 20 feet of you. The target can be a creature, object, or surface. If the target is Small or smaller, make a grapple check against it, pulling it to you and grappling it on a success. If the target is Medium or larger, you can instead pull yourself to it (no check required); this doesn\u2019t grapple the target. Opportunity attacks provoked by this movement are made with disadvantage. These added infusions inspired by various KibblesTasty's Inventor Class \"gadgets.\" Sight Lenses \u00b6 You create a set of lenses that allow you to see through darkness and obscurement, which you can integrate into a pair of goggles, glasses, or other vision assistance. While using these lenses, you can see through heavily obscured areas (such as fog, mist, smoke, clouds, and nonmagical darkness) out to a range of 15 feet.","title":"Artificer Infusion Replacements"},{"location":"Player%20Info/Artificer%20Infusion%20Replacements/#artificer-infusion-replacements","text":"","title":"Artificer Infusion Replacements"},{"location":"Player%20Info/Artificer%20Infusion%20Replacements/#tags-player-info","text":"","title":"tags: #player-info"},{"location":"Player%20Info/Artificer%20Infusion%20Replacements/#removed","text":"Enhanced Defense Enhanced Weapon Enhanced Arcane Focus","title":"Removed"},{"location":"Player%20Info/Artificer%20Infusion%20Replacements/#changed","text":"","title":"Changed"},{"location":"Player%20Info/Artificer%20Infusion%20Replacements/#radiant-weapon","text":"No longer grants a +1 to attack and damage rolls.

Character Creation \u00b6 Race/Origin/Lineage \u00b6 All races are available except Variant Human, use Custom Lineage from Tasha's instead. Highly recommend using the rules from Tasha's for origin ability score customization. If you're playing something from a book that isn't the PHB, Volo's or Eberron, reach out to me to make sure the backstory fits. Some Eberron Races in particular might have in-story baggage that you should be aware of: - Warforged are struggling to find their place in the post-war world, and there are plenty of opinions from plenty of people about what that place is. These attitudes are fair game for me to play with. - Dragonmarked variants of races typically have at least some ties to the Guild of that Mark, even if they have left the guild service formally, they at least know people there. Those strings are fair game for me to pull. - Some races are from nations which might have or recently have had conflicts with other nations, and those bonds are fair game for me to tug on. Motivations \u00b6 Your character will be the most motivated to play through this campaign's story if they are motivated by either: - Favor with a particular Guild or Faction (will have a list) - Cold hard Cash - General exploration and discovery of the unknowns Magic Items \u00b6 There are no +1/2/3 weapons or armor or spellcasting foci in this setting. Instead, magical items do magical things. Class Changes \u00b6 All Classes \u00b6 Any class with Optional Features from Tasha's Cauldron of Everything should have those features turned on. For features which replace other features, you may decide to not use those. Spellcasting \u00b6 All spellcasting classes may be treated as Prepared Spellcasting Classes. Artificer \u00b6 Infusions \u00b6 The \"Enhanced ____\" Infusions and all effects that add a \"+X\" to an item are removed. These infusions replace them: More Details about [[Artificer Infusions]] Feature Additions \u00b6 Project \u00b6 Artificers are always working on something . Using the Crafting Overview rules, pick an item that your character is working on crafting. As part of any long rest, you may make progress towards that item's completion, without affecting your ability to keep watch or interfere with your ability to take a long rest. If this item is magical in nature, it must be one of the items you are able to make with an infusion you know. Ready for Anything \u00b6 A number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, you may undergo a ritual lasting one minute which swaps out an Artificer spell you have prepared for another one of that same spell level. This does not apply to cantrips. Rules Note Rituals require concentration to execute, so any spell being concentrated on at the start of that minute will fade. Fighter \u00b6 Maneuvers \u00b6 Any maneuver learned may be treated as a \"prepared\" maneuver, meaning that as part of a long rest, you may switch that maneuver for another which is available to you. Ranger \u00b6 Feature Replacements \u00b6 Replace Natural Explorer with Deft Explorer. Replace Favored Enemy with Favored Foe. For Beast Master rangers, replace Ranger\u2019s Companion with Primal Companion. Rogue \u00b6 All Theif subclass features become part of the base class. Sorcerer \u00b6 All sorcerer subclasses have a list of subclass spells which are innately learned and do not count against the number of spells known. Font of Magic \u00b6 The number of Sorcery Points you have available to you increases to be equal to \"Sorcerer Level + Charisma Modifier\" (minimum 2). Metamagic \u00b6 Metamagic options are Prepared (you may switch them out at the end of a long rest). You can prepare a number of metamagic options equal to your proficiency bonus. Paladin \u00b6 Alternate Smite Effects \u00b6 Instead of the standard smite damage, you may cause the effects of any Smite Spell you have prepared. This does not count as casting a spell. If a smite has an ongoing effect and requires concentration, that is still the case. Warlock \u00b6 Warlocks may be Int based instead of Cha based if desired. Invocation Spells \u00b6 All Invocations spells may be cast without spending a Warlock spell slot, if they currently require such. All other limitations still apply. Wizard \u00b6 TBD - Something changes to counter the prepared-ness of other spellcasters Possibly the \"Ready for Anything\" from artificer modifications above. If you wanna play a wizard, reach out and lets talk. Contraditions to RAW \u00b6 Potions \u00b6 Pulling out a potion and drinking it yourself is a bonus action. Tossing a potion from player to player is a 'free' object interaction and is fine as long as it's one of the two players' turns, or there aren't extenuating circumstances. Force-feeding a potion is an action. Force-feeding a potion on an unwilling target is a contested check similar to a grapple. Spell Scrolls \u00b6 If you have an Arcana Proficiency you may attempt to cast a spell from a spell scroll by making an Arcana Check (DC equals 10 + the spell\u2019s level). Spell Scrolls of spells not on your spellcasting modifier or Intelligence Short Rests \u00b6 Short Rests take 10 minutes. Casting a ritual spell cannot count as a short rest. Fitful Rests \u00b6 Away from society's safety and security, long rests are only partially effective. Instead of restoring full resources and spell slots, only half of max are recovered from a fitful long rest. The rule of thumb is \"do you feel like you should be keeping watch?\" If so, you're getting in a fitful rest. Unseen Attackers \u00b6 A small tweak to how being unseen affects advantage and disadvantage. When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it if you can see it . Heavily Obscured Areas \u00b6 Heavily Obscured Areas (e.g. Fog Clouds, Not including full darkness) allow creatures to see well enough within 5ft around them for attacks made against unhidden creatures within that range to not fall under the \"unseen attackers\" rules. Augmentations to RAW \u00b6 True Ritual Casting \u00b6 Any spell that can be Ritual Cast that also has a material component with a gold cost can be done so without the spell prepared provided the caster can Ritual Cast spells and has access to that spell. Unexpected Stops \u00b6 If an object or creature is subjected to an effect that would apply forced movement for some number of feet but they are stopped by a solid surface before that many feet can be moved, both things take 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10ft the moving thing wasn't able to move. If the moving object or creature is going to collide with another creature of the same size or smaller, that creature must make a DEX Save (DC 10) or both creatures will be prone. On a success the moving thing does not get stopped (the creature dodged out of the way). Exhaustion \u00b6 RAW doesn't use exhaustion very much but it's a good idea that allows us to tinker with the concept of \"over extending.\" Going without sleep \u00b6 We'll be using a more forgiving tweak of the Optional Rules from Xanathar's Guide to Everything: Whenever you end a 48-hour period without finishing a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. It becomes harder to fight off exhaustion if you stay awake for multiple days. After the first 48 hours, the DC increases by 5 for each consecutive 24-hour period without a long rest. The DC resets to 10 when you finish a long rest. Exhaustive Magic \u00b6 In dire circumstances, the time may come when you want to make magic flow more freely from your body. For each \"magical resource\" (class feature or spellcasting, ask if you're not sure) you spend where you would normally not be allowed to, make a constitution save against your spellcasting DC. If you succeed, the spell is cast. If you fail, the spell is not cast and the slot is lost. Either way, the caster gains one level of exhaustion . Explanation: Some magical class features with resources attached (Arcane Shot) specify that they are only allowed to be used once per turn. Spellcasting falls into this bucket as well. This ruling allows multiple leveled spells to be attempted on one turn in dire straits. Example \u00b6 Vista is close to death and within range of Cheya's Healing Word (Lv1) spell. She also wants to cast Entangle (Lv1) on this turn. RAW the rules about casting times state that she can not cast both of these spells on the same turn. With Exhaustive Magic, Cheya can choose which spell to cast first for a garunteed cast, then attempt to extert herself to cast the second spell, gaining a point of exhaustion. Cheya casts Healing Word, she doesn't want Vista to die. Cheya tries to cast Entangle, make CON Save against her own Spell Save DC.
