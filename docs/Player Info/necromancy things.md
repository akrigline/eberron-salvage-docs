Desire:

A caster, weak and frail on their own, but with the power to animate and create their own little army which they can devote their whole turn to commanding.

Gonna work in concentration on this, that'll be a big balancer. Which means your minions have to contend with existing wizard concentration spells at each level.

Also gonna work in using your full action to accomplish things. Which means your minions have to contend with just casting a spell.

ALSO gonna need some resource to power this so it's not straight busted all of the time. 

Try based on Wizard, Druid? _Waaaarlock??_

Might need to rework into a half-caster with class features that use your action to do, artificer?

Artificer with Infusions to power up the undead you can make?

---

**Spellcasting**: Artificer Progresion; Warlock(?) Spell List, Prepared

**Subclass Selection**

ASI Levels: 4, 8, 12, 16, 19

## Puppet

At level 1 your puppets' attacks do 1d4 damage. Increases to 1d6 at level 5, 1d8 at level 11, 1d10 at level 17.

You may command a number of puppets equal to your profiency bonus.

When a puppet dies, its remains crumble into dust.

As an action on your turn you may command your puppets to do a number of activities equal to your Charisma Modifier, divided among your puppets as you desire. You may only command puppets within 60ft of you. If a puppet is ever more than 60ft away from you, it falls unconscious.


Activities:
- Move
- Attack (Single strike or grapple/shove)
- Help
- Use an Item

Not available:
- Dodge
- Disengage

As a reaction you can order a puppet to take a reaction. Puppets cannot take reactions on their own.

Statblocks

Each tier has a set of variant statblocks which are chosen at time of creation.

All Puppets:
HP: 5 + Level + PB
To Hit: Spell Attack?
Save DC: Spell DC?

Tier 1 Puppet: Lesser (level 1, d4)
AC: 5 + PB

Tier 2 Puppet: Minor (level 5, d6)
AC: 8 + PB

Tier 3 Puppet: Greater (level 11, d8)
AC: 10 + PB

Tier 4 Puppet: Major (level 17, d10)
AC: 15 + PB

## Level 2 Class Features
"KI" resource equal to your Level

Class Feature: When a creature you can see within 60ft makes an attack roll or saving throw, you may spend one Ki point to subtract your Cha modifier from that roll. You may do this a number of times equal to your Cha modifier per long rest.


## Level 3
If you cast a spell as an action on your turn, you may spend a ki point as a bonus action to command your puppets to take prof/2 (round up) activities.

## Level 7 Class Feature
Dominate Puppet. As an action, you may attempt to temporarily gain control of an undead of construct within 60ft of you. After using this feature you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

If the creature has a Charisma Score lower than your Charisma Modifier, it automatically fails to resist. Otherwise, they make a Charisma Saving Throw against your Spell Save DC. If the creature is the puppet of another Puppeteer, a contested check happens.

If you succeed, you Charm the target, ignoring any immunities to the Charm condition that target may have. While charmed in this way, it counts as a Puppet for you in every way, but does not count against the number of puppets you can control at once.

It will remain charmed by you for 1 hour, or until you lose concentration, as though concentrating on a spell.

The creature makes a Charisma Saving Throw each time it takes damage. On a success, this effect ends and the creature knows you had control over it.


## Necromancer

## Level 1 Feature
You learn how to create Undead puppets, see below. Doing so normally takes 1 minute and is a ritual requiring concentration.

Subclass Feature: Redirect attack directed at you to a puppet within 5ft of you as a reaction.

You gain proficiency in the Religion and Medicine skills, if you already have these, choose others. You have advantage on knowledge checks related to undead creatures.

#### Level 3 Feature
Subclass Feature: When a creature dies within 60ft of you, you may spend a "ki" point as a reaction to cause it to move up to half its speed and make one weapon attack.

#### Level 6 Feature
You can expend a spell slot as a bonus action targeting the corpse of a creature that died within the last minute within 60ft to cause that corpse to transform into a puppet under your control. This has no effect on the corpses of undead or constructs.

#### Level 9 Feature
Blood Sacrifice
Sacrifice a Minon to Heal (double?) its current health to an ally within 30ft of it.


#### Undead Puppets

Each variant has 2 special things:
- One passive trait that helps them in their role.
- One Ki-powered special power each which should be roughly a battle master maneuver. Remember it's possible to do many of these in a turn.


#### Tier 1 Puppet: Lesser (level 1, d4)
AC: 5 + PB


> ##### Lesser Bone Puppet (Dex)
> - Passive: Ranged Weapon Attacks (Shortbow Range 80/320)
