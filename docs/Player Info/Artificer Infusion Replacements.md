## Changed

### Radiant Weapon
No longer grants a +1 to attack and damage rolls.

Reaction is now usable before the attack hits.

<details><summary>Rationale</summary> This weapon already has a cool ability attached, a minor tweak to make it possible to blind a creature before they hit you, possibly making it miss, is enough to compensate for the missing +1.</details>


### Repeating Shot
No longer grants a +1 to attack and damage rolls.

On rolling a 20 on the damage die, this weapon immediately fires a second shot (this second shot cannot proc a third shot).

<details><summary>Rationale</summary>Having a crossbow you can use without the crossbow master feat is a small perk, but having that crossbow accidentally fire two bolts sometimes is a great perk.</details>

_Lovingly inspired by Critical Role S2_



### Repulsion Shield
No longer grants a +1 to AC.

After being knocked back, if the creature is Large or smaller, they are also knocked prone.


<details><summary>Rationale</summary>Pushing a creature back only to have them immediately stand up and walk back to you, or even worse flee is decidedly worse than most alternative actions. Knocking the creature prone as well gives this a decent chance of making it so that the creature can't get back at you or your friends on this turn.</details>


### Returning Weapon
No longer grants a +1 to attack and damage rolls.

Applicable to any one-handed weapon without the "Versatile" property.

Grants the weapon the "Thrown" property with a range of 20/60, if it did not already have the thrown property.

<details><summary>Rationale</summary>The most abuse this can suffer is a Throw-able 1d8 damage weapon, which is the same as a Light Crossbow, with dramatically decreased range. Without this infusion, the maximum damage die for a throw-able weapon is 1d6 (Spear/Javelin/Trident). This comes out to an average of +1 damage on such a weapon without the bonus to attacks, which is about the bonus before anyways.</details>


## Added

### Smoke Bomb
As an action, you can use a smoke bomb to cast the fog cloud spell centered on yourself, without expending a spell slot and requiring no components. The spell lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier and doesn’t require your concentration.

When you cast fog cloud in this way, you can choose for it to have a radius of 5, 10, 15, or 20 feet.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short rest.

### Shocking Weapon
When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target must succeed a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or become stunned until the start of your next turn.

### Grappling Hook
You can forgo any attack you make as part of the Attack action to throw your grappling hook at a target within 20 feet of you. The target can be a creature, object, or surface. If the target is Small or smaller, make a grapple check against it, pulling it to you and grappling it on a success.

If the target is Medium or larger, you can instead pull yourself to it (no check required); this doesn’t grapple the target. Opportunity attacks provoked by this movement are made with disadvantage.

These added infusions inspired by various KibblesTasty's Inventor Class "gadgets."

### Sight Lenses
You create a set of lenses that allow you to see through darkness and obscurement, which you can integrate into a pair of goggles, glasses, or other vision assistance. While using these lenses, you can see through heavily obscured areas (such as fog, mist, smoke, clouds, and nonmagical darkness) out to a range of 15 feet.
