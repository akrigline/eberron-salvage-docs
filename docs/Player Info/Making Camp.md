# Making Camp
###### tags: #player-info #homebrew

Setting up for a long rest during travel in the wilds involves creating a Campsite and resting. This process usually takes longer than 8 hours, but doing so ensures finding a good place to rest and allows some other downtime activities.

Some things have to be done while camping:
- Keeping Watch (or else you risk surprise)
- Resting (or else you risk exhaustion)

Other things though are optional for the brief downtime:
- Crafting
  - Cooking
- Studying and Preparing
- Relieving Stress
  - Storytelling
  - Engaging a Vice
