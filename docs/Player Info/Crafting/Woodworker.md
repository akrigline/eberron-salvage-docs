Typically work on wooden items that can be carried, thrown, or wielded.

Often uses:

- Woodcarver's Tools
- Carpenter's Tools

## Materials
Wood! Expensive wood, cheap wood, wood scraps, magic wood, mundane wood, etc. etc. etc.

Wood in this case is usually measured in "Branches", and some aspects of woodcarving require Fletching or Arcane Essences as well.

## Synergies
Woodworkers typically work together with [[Blacksmith]]s or [[Textile Worker]]s to build more complex items.
[[Calligrapher]]s often help woodworkers enhance their work.
Fletchers will sometimes enlist [[Chemist]]s to enhance their arrows with alchemical substances.

## Areas of Work

### Woodcarving
Wood is a versatile medium for those who know how to shape it. Many Simple Weapons, Shields, Musical Instruments, and other miscellanea can be made entirely from wood.

### Fletching
Archery Ammunition has been traditionally wood-based for a long time. Being able to make specialty arrows, or components to make specialty arrows is a very useful skill.

### Wandwhittling
Wands are unlike other magic items because the act of infusing the item happens at the same time as carving the wood. 
Magical Wands are very difficult to make.
